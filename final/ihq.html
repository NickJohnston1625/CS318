    <h1>International Headquarters</h1>
        
    <h2>As a national orginization</h2>
        
    <p class="para">Phi Gamma Delta was founded April 22, 1848 at Jefferson college in Pennsylvania. The founders were John Templeton McCarty, Samuel Beatty Wilson, James Elliott Jr., Ellis Bailey Gregg, Daniel Webster Crofts, and Naaman Fletcher, they are commonly referred to as “the immortal six”. Even though it was founded on April 22nd , May 1st is the official founder’s day because that is when the constitution was adopted. Phi Gamma Delta currently has 148 chapters and 13 colonies throughout the U.S. and Canada, and is commonly referred to as “FIJI”. The five core values of the fraternity are friendship, knowledge, service, morality, and excellence. This fraternity is known for its popular saying: “not for college days alone”. Once Fiji members graduate they are not referred to as alumni but rather “graduate brothers”.

    <h2>Traditions</h2>
    
    <h4>Frank Norris Pig dinner</h4>
        
    <p class="para">One of the many traditions of this fraternity is the Frank Norris Pig Dinner event, which is held annually. It is rooted around a story from 1893 about a brother named Ralph Hathorn, who was irritated by the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Beta Theta Pi fraternities for monopolizing a lot of campus activities including the “glee club”. In that day and age “glee club” was important for entertainment because there wasn’t radio or TV. Hathorn brought a barrel labeled “U. of C. Glee Club” onto a platform, out of it came a squealing pig, which was supposed to be a comment about the “Dekes” and “Betas” singing abilities. After this the pig stayed in the FIJI’s house and Hathorn had every member renew his bond of allegiance, fidelity and alliance and then seal it with a kiss on the pig’s snout. Norris later proposed that they commemorate the occasion with a perennial Pig Dinner event. The annual Pig Dinner festivities were dedicated to Frank Norris after his death in 1902, and then spread to other chapters of the fraternity.

    <h4>Symbols</h4>
    
    <p class="para">There are many symbols that the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity uses, one of them is their Recognition Badge that was created in 1910, which is a black diamond with a white star in the middle, it is for initiates and reflects the Founder’s badge. Another is their Official Seal, which dates back to the 1860’s, it pictures a handshake over a book with their Greek letters above and sunrays from every direction and their motto “Fortiter, Fideliter, Feliciter” underneath. Additionally, they have a Heraldic Insignia, which dates back to 1879, it depicts a coat of arms, a gold shield with three American Roses, a purple chevron with three silver stars through it. The Snowy White Owl mascot sits on top of the coat of arms and a banner underneath has that same motto on it. The fraternities official flower is the Purple Clematis, the official mascot is the Snowy White Owl, and the official flag has a royal purple background with their Greek initials in the center and a star in the upper right-hand corner, which are both in white.

    <h4>Songs</h4>
    
    <p class="para">Phi Gamma Delta printed its first of many songbooks in the year 1886, the first official record was recorded in 1922 and the most recent one was recorded in 1960. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>Sires and Sons</h4>
    
    <p class="para">Six members of the fraternity celebrated Founder’s Day in 1925 by orchestrating the Fiji Sires and Sons. They wanted to create a list of all Fiji fathers and their sons, in 1964 an issue of The Phi Gamma Delta announced that there would be certificates sent to each Fiji sire and Fiji son that was on file. After this announcement there were tons of requests and by the end of the year 1,800 Fijis were able to display their Sires and Sons certificates. Only Fijis who have Fiji sons or Fijis who have  Fiji fathers are eligible for this distinction.
